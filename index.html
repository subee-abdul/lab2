								when's the last time you have had an italian soda? it had been a while for me, but i wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated everage at Byte and i became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water.The italian sodas at bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; i haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesnt have coffeine or milk.</p>
